# TrustDevice-Android
A lightweight library for determining device uniqueness and risk identification.

Create a device identifier based on basic device information.

Will remain the same after uninstalling and reinstalling or clearing app data.

## Quick start

### 1. Add repository

Add these lines to your `build.gradle`.
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

If your version of Gradle is 7 or newer, add these lines to your `settings.gradle`:
```groovy
repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
```

### 2. Add dependency

Add these lines to `build.gradle` of a module.
```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.trustdecision:trustdevice-android:1.0.0'
}
```

### 3. Get deviceInfo

DeviceInfo contains device id, risk information and device details.

#### 3.1. Option 1

```java
// initialization
TDRisk.init(context);

// usage
JSONObject deviceInfo = TDRisk.getBlackbox();
// Obtain deviceid and risk information through deviceInfo
String deviceID = deviceInfo.optString("device_id");
JSONObject deviceRisk = deviceInfo.optJSONObject("device_risk_label");
JSONObject deviceDetail = deviceInfo.optJSONObject("device_detail");
```

`getBlackbox` method executes in the calling thread and takes time to execute.

#### 3.1.2. Option 2

```java
TDRisk.Builder builder = new TDRisk.Builder();
builder.callback(new TDRiskCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onEvent(JSONObject deviceInfo) {
      	// Obtain deviceid and risk information through deviceInfo
        String deviceID = deviceInfo.optString("device_id");
        JSONObject deviceRisk = deviceInfo.optJSONObject("device_risk_label");
        JSONObject deviceDetail = deviceInfo.optJSONObject("device_detail");
    }
});
TDRisk.initWithOptions(context, builder);
```

`callback` is in a sub-thread, please do not perform UI operations.
