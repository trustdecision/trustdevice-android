<p><i>TrustDevice</i> is a lightweight library for determining device uniqueness and risk identification. It can create a device identifier based on basic device information. Tis will remain the same after uninstalling and reinstalling or clearing app data.</p><p>This demo application shows you the details gathered and thus is useful for getting detailed device information. As a side effect it shows you what data an app can access without having any permissions – and could transfer it to „some servers“ if it had just the <code>INTERNET</code> permission.</p>
